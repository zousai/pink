1. [[introduce yourself?]]
My name is zousai. I'm working at the R&D department of a company. My company is dedicated to the Marine power equipment. I'm a program director specialized in project scheduling management and I'm also a program manager responsible for the projects performance management.
As a program director, I set up the time planning control mechanism for my company. I'm responsible to supervise all of the projects process to make sure that everything works effeciently and smoothly.
As a program director, I have set up the project member performance evaluation mecanism, which is featured in results-oriented evaluation. We evaluate a people mostly on their working achievement.
I like my job because I like time management and systematic thinking. In life, I think that everything is like a project. I'm also good at manage my time. 
However, as i have accummulated many experiences in my company, i gradually find that time management itself is not a core issue in a R&D organizition. i konw that in the manufacturing process, time management is really important. Considering that i'm also want to improve myself to have a better development in my career. i set my goal to become a professional operation project manager who is responsible for optimizing the production process. I hope to have a significance influence in the efficient promotion in manufacturing industry. 
Although i have rich experience in the R&D area, i lack the knowledge and experience in supply chain and operation. So after careful consideration, i decide to have a further educaton in order to realize my career planning. That's why i came here to apply for the CLGO project. i would be very appreciate if i could gain your recognition. Thank you.

2. [[What do you expect to learn in your MBA program?]]
I want to be an excellent supply chain operation manager in the manufacturing industry. 
So in order to realize my orientation. 
First, I need to know how to manage production and manufacture, how to balance the supply and demand among different departments, how to optimize production line, how to lower the cost in the production process. I believe that there must be some solutions in the basic subjects what CLGO offer. So i need to find these solutions in the subjects and master the problem-solving capacity.
Second, i want to learn the management strategies and methods used in other companies and obtain the experiences from their applications.
Last, i expect to participate in practical activities to accumulate the real experience in the period of my learning time.

3. [[Why don't take part-time program?]]
Thank you for your question. Actually, i have had the same question, and I consulted to my ex-superior for his suggestion. He thought for while and told me that i should choose CLGO. his reason was that my experience and capacity has supass the diploma from the business school. What i need is to get the really valuable knowledge related to my future career development.
I was really appreciate for his comments. 
After a long time of deep understanding, i konw that the whole-time program is a highly valuable program, with closely match to my future career planning. 
i choose the whole-time program because of CLGO program. Because of It's training direction, it's rigorous schorlarship spirit, and high-level education resourses. 

4. [[Why you want to quit your company?]]
I really appreciate my company for giving me chance to take the important responsibility of program management. But i still want to have more growth space to solve the basic and significant problems in the manufacturing industry. 
I'm good at project management,but what i really want to do is production operation management. it's more challenging for me. And it's really meaningful for the manufacturing industry. so i want to quit my job to do something i really like.
important
(anything else……
It's not easy for me to step out of my line of business and take the supply chain operation responsibility of the industry. It's not only because my working role is very significant for my departament, but only because that my company is a R&D organizition in the industry. But i want to have an influence in The Whole marine power equipment indusry. )

5. [[Tell me something about your hobbies ]]
My hobbies are taking exercise and reading books. 
Taking exercise makes me feel energetic. I like to challenge myself by taking marathon competition every year and i have taken exercise 5 times a week for 3 years.
Reading books makes me open my mind and find the inner energy. Last year i have read 50 books, and i really like to take reading notes for these books.

6. [[我们不想要你了，你还有什么话要对我们说？]]
Last year I determined my career plan and applied for the CLGO program. During the long time of preparing for the interviews and exams, I feel like that i have found my passion and i am doing something that can realize my dream. 
I think that my advantages have not been fully demonstrated. In my current company, i have surpassed most of my peers in working achievement. And I have doubled my salary in three years because of my working performance. My superior told me that i could create this miracle again. And I believe I can do it.
So i really treasure this opportunity and i will be very appreciated for your second thought. 

7. [[Challenge of your work?]]
The projects i have undertaken are the most significant and complex ones in the marine engine industry. As a program director, I'm responsible for organizing 42 companies to work together on the same program. So i must have a deep understanding of the businesses and of different companies, and set up a practical and manageable criterion to control the program process. The difficulties and complexities of the program are the challenges for me.

CLGO program has the perfect operation management course system and the best teaching resources. it will enable me to learn the most hardcore/valuable  knowledge.
CLGO program is a model of school & enterprise cooperation in China. So i will have lots of excellent learning action resources. Through the CLGO program, i will find an internship oppotunity to work as a OPM in an enterprise. which can help me have a smooth transition in my career.What is the most unforgettable memory during the last five years in your company

9. [[What is the most unforgettable memory during the last five years in your company]]
Since I’ve been on the job, every spring, I organize the whole company to go outing. one year we went to 徽杭古道 to go hiking. Unfortunately, we caught a big rainstorm, but the tp couldn't be cancelled. So i organized to buy thick raincoats and rain shoes for everyone. To my surprised, we all in high enthusiasm for this special hiking. The eight-hour hike in the storm left us with a deep and happy memory.
Another time, we climbed 括苍山, the mountain was very steep and difficult for most of us. There were 63 of us, young and old. The youngest was only 4 years old. We used both hands and feet in the process of climbing the mountain. In the process, many of us wanted to give up many times, but with the help of the team and the encouragement of others, everyone gets to the top before it gets dark.
What i have learned from these activities was that people's piritual power is unlimited and can be inspired from teamwork. The trust between pople is really eccouraging and priceless.

10. [[What is your strength and weakness?]]
my strength is that i have strong willpower. i'm always stick to my goal and work hard to have a good performance.
my weakness is that my voice kind of sound like a kid. which may make pople think i'm unprofessional when they first approach me. But actually, i have goal-oriented personality. i really want to give others an impression that i'm professional. so i'm very serious and stick to principal at work. in this way, i'm given back more reapect and trust.

11. [[Say something about your personality]]
i'm outgoing and easygoing, responsible and flexiable.
i'm easy to communicate and coorperate with others.
i think ererything can work as a project. No matter at work or in my life, i stick to my goal and plan. At the same time, i'm flexible at the working methods.

12. [[Who is your idol? Why do you like him/her?]]
My current role model is 稻盛和夫. I've read his law of doing and law of living thoroughly. I agree with his philosophy of life and work. He said: "Life is the process of constantly improving your heart and refining your soul" , He also said that we should "pay the efforts no less than anyone". These philosophies are my motto. 

13. [[Can you highlight yourself a little bit?]]
In my current company, i have surpassed most of my peers in working achievement. And I have doubled my salary in three years because of my working performance. My superior told me that i could create this miracle again. And I believe I can do it.


14. [[Say something about your university/major.]]
Jiangsu university of science and technology was first set in shanghai and then moved to Zhenjiang.  My college doesn’t has a title, but it is famous in the marine shipping industry. Lots of students graduate from there choose to work in the shipping industry. I’m no exception. 
It seems like my college always gives students lots of restrictions. We must get up early to do morning exercises and morning reading. We must study at night in the definite classroom. But my college also gave us enough freedom to do creative projects and start-up projects. We students have enough capacity to be creative and join in variety of activities.

15. [[What was the most successful thing you did during that time?]]
The most successful things I have done at college may be my part-time job experiences.
I have done many part-time job at college. Including clean up dishes in the college canteen and sell refrigerators at the shopping mall. At first time, I was too afraid of losing face in front of my classmates, and I was too shy to sell products to others. I did these only because I wanted to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone.
Lastly, I didn’t lose my classmates respect at all. On the contrary, they showed me their admiration in front of me. 
Because of my serious working attitude, I became the best part-time seller in the shopping mall and won the manager’s high approval.
After that, the canteen and shopping mall managers frequently connected me to ask if I have time to do part-time jobs or if I could recommend some of my classmates to help them. So i set up the part-time association to offer oppotunities for my classmates to take on part-time job.
